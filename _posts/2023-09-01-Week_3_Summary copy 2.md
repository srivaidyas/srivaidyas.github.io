#### Tuesday
We started the day by wroking on last weeks review and completing the pending projects that were left from last week. We then started by looking into slack and completeing the basic stuff that needed to be done for the week. Coming to the main project of the week, the pair showcase, we both had completed our code for each of out projects which include the wikipedia search box and the movie search box too.

#### Wednesday
WE started the day by debugging the code that we worked on for our pair showcase. We found there were a few many bugs in our code and asked chat gpt as well as a few other classmates to help and managed to better our code and sign up for the pair showcase tommorow with Mr. Lopez. We then also began working on another projects with API from chatgpt as a search box on chatgpt. We completed out day by making a summary of each part of our code and explained in detail what and how this code works.

#### Thursday
We started our day by checking the sign up sheet and we were signed up with MR Lopez but unforntunetely he seemed to be busy for the day and our review was pushed a day further. We did nothing much and just chilled out throughout the class period.

#### Friday
Today was the day for our live review. Mr Lopez agreed to live review us and we explained each and every part ouf our codes and how it works, as well as what it does. We also showed him our new projects and also explained in detail how these APIs work in real life. Mr. Lopez seemed to be happy with the porgress and collaboration we did with our coding journey and gave us a 4.97 out of 5 points for the live review.
