    "- [X] Create an object representing yourself as a person. The object should have keys for your name, age, current classes, interests, and two more of your choosing\n",
    "- [X] Your object must contain keys whose values are arrays. The arrays can be arrays of strings, numbers, or even other objects if you would like\n",

    "- [X] Manipulate the arrays within the object and print the entire object with console.log as well as the specific changed key afterwards\n",
    "- [X]Perform mathematical operations on fields in your object such as +, -, /, % etc. and print the results with console.log along with a message contextualizing them\n",
